# Prototyping
Python prototypes for various projects, usually written in other languages like Java, C, or C++.

Cinema.py is the primary prototype for MonarchyPOS, where most prototyping eventually merges to demo concepts put together for the whole program.

lists.py is currently serving two functions:
1. Storing lists for the selection menus.
2. Creating function for user selection menus. The functions in this file are first drafts and will be fixed later.

I haven't written in python since college but it's really useful for prototyping and unit tests so I am refreshing my memory with these projects. I know there are better ways of doing most of this and I will implement them once I get to that point in my relearning.
